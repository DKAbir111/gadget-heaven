## React Concepts and Tools Used

- **React Router** for navigation between pages and dynamic routes (enabling seamless transitions between different pages and loading content dynamically based on URL parameters).
- **Context API** for managing global state (Cart, Wishlist).
- **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`) for managing component state and handling navigation.
- **React Toastify** for toasts that notify users about adding/removing items from the cart and wishlist.
- **React Icons** for displaying cart, wishlist, and other icons.
- **Recharts** for displaying charts in the statistics page.
- **React Rating** component for product ratings.
- **LocalStorage** for persisting cart and wishlist data across page reloads (optional).
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first CSS styling.
- **DaisyUI** for pre-built Tailwind components (e.g., buttons, modals, form elements) to speed up UI development.
